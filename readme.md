**This program maximizes the AirReceiver application. By executing this script, you can build it using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/).**

**Usage example:**

**you can build this main.py and put it in autostart and then you have a Apple Airplay 2/DLNA/Google Chromecast/Miracast Device**

**you can use for this a Fujitsu ESPRIMO or Lenovo ThinkCentre or some old goofy ahh potato pc/notebook**

**Install:**

**put a shortcut of AirReceiver in the folder of the .py script and execute the script**

**Requirements:**
 - AirReceiver (obviously) -> [App on MStore](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PJMSWQ0G6GC?hl=neutral&gl=DE&ocid=pdpshare)
 - Python 3.11 or later (only tested on it) 
 - PyAutoGUI (Package)
 - PyGetWindow (Package)
 - Windows 10 or later (8 maybe also work, because it has the Windows Store / Microsoft Store, but i didn't tested it)
 - 5GHz for good experience (i only recommend it, also works with a 2,4GHz Network)
